# CYBOP-Benchmark

Simple benchmark to compare CYBOL with other programming languages.

Pseudocode:

```
loop from 0 to 1000000:
  var test;
  test = Addition
  test = Substraction
  test = Division
  test = Multiplication
  Absolute value of test
  innerLoop();
end loop
  
innerLoop():
  loop from 0 to 100000:
    i++;
    if(i % 2 == 0):
      print i;
end loop      
```
